# CSCE435 Project

Currently Up to date

MPI:
 In order to run once built use sbatch mpi.grace_job (number) number_of_processors
 In Lab 2 (number) was arrays but I wasnt sure how to change that properly since the data is somewhat
 hard coded right now. And I couldnt get the job to run trying to get rid of it. 

 CUDA:
   In order to rune once built use sbatch bitonic.grace_job number_of_threads
   I couldnt figure out how to change the bitonic part without it not working (lol)
   Data is hard coded in this as well.

  Will ask in OH about changing the parts I would like to change, as well as how I should handle the data generation -
  as in should the User be able to set it, for implementation purposes.
