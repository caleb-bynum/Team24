# CSCE435 Project

Currently Up to date

MPI:<br>
 In order to run once built use sbatch mpi.grace_job <data_size> <number of processors> <br>
 Data is currently randomly generated, will add more options for evaluation later <br>

 CUDA:<br>
   In order to run once built use sbatch mergesort.grace_job <data_size> <number of threads><br>
   Data is currently randomly generated, will add more options for evaluation later<br>


  Currently data type is INT, will change to float for evaluations <br>
