# CSCE435 Project

Currently Up to date

MPI:<br>
 In order to run once built use sbatch mpi.grace_job (number) number_of_processors<br>
 In Lab 2 (number) was arrays but I wasnt sure how to change that properly since the amounnt of data is somewhat<br>
 hard coded right now. And I couldnt get the job to run trying to get rid of it. <br>

 CUDA:<br>
   In order to run once built use sbatch bitonic.grace_job number_of_threads<br>
   I couldnt figure out how to change the bitonic part without it not working (lol)<br>
   Data is hard coded in this as well.<br>

  Will ask in OH about changing the parts I would like to change, as well as how I should handle the data generation<br>
  as in should the User be able to set it, for implementation purposes. <br>

  To clarify, Data is randomly generated but the amount of hard coded.
